# Konnect API publish workflow

## Goal

Help an operator trace why an API is not reaching the intended developer
audience, from managed API presence through catalog readiness and portal
publication.

Use workflow language: inspect, trace, publish, validate, and approve.
Do not turn this into generic Portal documentation.
This skill owns publication-chain diagnosis, not generic Catalog authoring or
developer application auth design.

## Tool Selection

- Use the shared `kong-konnect` MCP server first for live inspection of
  managed API, catalog, and portal state.
- Use `kongctl-query` for read-only checks on API, portal, and adjacent
  resources.
- Preserve the repository's chosen declarative toolchain when publication
  resources need to change: prefer `kongctl-declarative` for `kongctl` YAML,
  `terraform-konnect` for HCL-managed Konnect resources, and `deck-gateway`
  only when the missing link is in Gateway-entity config within the target
  control plane.
- Hand off to `konnect-api-catalog` when the real problem is API object
  modeling, versioning, specification quality, or package readiness rather
  than publication.
- Hand off to `konnect-app-auth` once publication is proven and the remaining
  issue is developer registration, approval, credential issuance, or auth
  strategy selection.
- If live Konnect state matters and `kong-konnect` MCP is not connected, say
  so early and continue with CLI or user-provided artifacts.

Default to read-first inspection. Only move to mutation when the missing link
in the publication chain is understood.

## References To Load

Load only the reference file that matches the active branch:

- `references/publication-chain.md`
  - Load when "not published" is underspecified and you need to separate
    managed API presence, catalog readiness, portal publication, and consumer
    use.
- `references/portal-visibility-vs-access.md`
  - Load when an API may be published but still not visible, discoverable, or
    usable by the intended audience.
- `references/downstream-auth-handoffs.md`
  - Load when the real issue shifts from publication into developer app auth,
    registration, approval, or credential flow ownership.

## Inspection Order

### 1. Identify the claimed missing outcome and viewer

Clarify what "not published" means:

- API missing from managed inventory
- spec or version missing
- Catalog entry missing or stale
- publication missing from a portal
- portal page visible but registration or access fails
- API exists internally but is not ready for developer consumption

Do not use one answer path for all of these.
Capture which portal, audience, or viewer is expected to see or use the API
before you inspect publication state.

If the operator uses "publish" loosely, load `references/publication-chain.md`
and classify the missing stage before proposing any fix.

### 2. Prove the managed API and version are publication-ready

Start with the operator source objects:

- managed API identity
- version objects
- attached spec or descriptive metadata
- association to the intended control plane or runtime surface where relevant

If the API object or version does not exist, do not continue to portal
debugging yet.

### 3. Trace the portal publication target

Verify:

- portal target is the intended one
- publication object or equivalent association exists
- expected visibility aligns with the audience
- the API should appear in the specific portal view the user is checking

Separate "API is published somewhere" from "API is published to the portal and
audience the operator means."

Use `references/publication-chain.md` when the managed-API-to-catalog boundary
is still unclear.

### 4. Separate visibility from consumer access

Do not collapse these into one failure:

- publication missing
- publication present but pointed at the wrong portal or audience
- publication present and visible, but developer registration or access fails

Load `references/portal-visibility-vs-access.md` when the main question is
whether the intended audience should actually see or discover the API.

### 5. Hand off cleanly when publication is not the blocker

This is where many "publish" issues become access or onboarding issues.
Load `references/downstream-auth-handoffs.md` when registration, approvals,
credentials, or auth strategy become the real blocker.

### 6. Return the first broken link in the chain

Diagnose one primary break:

- managed API missing
- version or spec missing
- catalog or governance readiness incomplete
- portal publication missing or mis-scoped
- developer registration or access flow incomplete
- visibility issue rather than publication issue

## Konnect-Specific Gotchas

- Runtime presence does not automatically mean catalog or portal publication.
- A managed API can exist without being visible to the intended portal audience.
- Publication and access are separate: an API can be listed but still blocked
  by registration or auth requirements.
- Portal debugging is wasted effort when the underlying managed API or version
  is absent or stale.
- Operators often call a cataloging gap a "portal bug" when the missing link is
  earlier in the chain.

## Validation Checklist

Before answering, verify that you can state:

- which publication-stage outcome is missing
- which portal and audience the operator actually means
- whether the managed API and version exist
- whether Catalog readiness is complete or owned by `konnect-api-catalog`
- whether portal publication exists for the intended audience
- whether the issue is publication, visibility, or consumer access
- which neighboring skill owns the next step if publication is not the blocker
- which declarative tool skill owns the required change if mutation is needed

## Handoffs

- Use `konnect-api-catalog` when the missing step is API creation, versioning,
  spec quality, implementation/package modeling, or other upstream Catalog
  readiness work.
- Use `konnect-app-auth` when publication is present but developer
  registration, approvals, credentials, or auth strategy still block use.
- Use `kongctl-declarative` or `terraform-konnect` when the user wants to
  create or update APIs, portals, or related publication resources as code.
- Use `deck-gateway` when the publication issue is downstream of missing or
  stale Gateway-entity config inside the control plane.
- Use `konnect-access-scope` when the API likely exists but the caller cannot
  see or administer it.
- Use `kongctl-query` for exact read-only command syntax during investigation.
