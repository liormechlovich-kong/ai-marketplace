## Notes

- If a power includes MCP integrations, Kiro registers them in
  `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` under the Powers section.
- This power currently installs skills only. Configure `kong-konnect` in
  Kiro's user-level MCP settings when live access is needed, and keep the
  bearer token out of the checked-in power. Agent Plugins 1.0.0 cannot
  portably represent the API-key header before Konnect MCP OAuth is available.
- To install from GitHub:

   ```bash
   gh skill install kong/ai-marketplace
   ```

   Install one skill:

   ```bash
   gh skill install kong/ai-marketplace gateway-plugin-datakit
   ```
