# Testing

This repo favors lightweight checks over tool-driven install automation.

## Prerequisites

Start with the contributor bootstrap:

```bash
mise trust
mise install
mise run preflight
mise run deps
mise run hooks:install
```

Baseline local tools:

- `mise`
- `uv`
- `git`

`mise run preflight` checks the repo's baseline tools and can also check
optional flows:

- `mise run preflight -- publish` for `gh skill publish --dry-run`
- `mise run preflight -- shared-installers` for `npx skills` and `gh skill`
- `mise run preflight -- all` for a full local tool sweep

## Default Workflow

1. Run `mise run preflight`.
2. Run `mise run deps`.
3. Run `mise run hooks:install` once per checkout.
4. Run `mise run lint`.
5. Run `gh skill publish --dry-run` when you change skill metadata or prepare a release, or use `mise run ci` to include it in the standard CI path.
6. If you changed install docs, plugin manifests, or MCP config surfaces, manually verify only the affected tools.
7. Use a scratch project or disposable user profile when a tool writes local state.

Use the smallest path that covers the change. Most edits do not require every
check.

`mise run lint` covers more than generated-file drift. It is also the repo's
default authoring guardrail for:

- Agent Plugins 1.0.0 validation against pinned local schemas
- Agent Skills validation through `skills-ref`
- scaffold placeholders
- `SKILL.md` length
- description budget
- high-similarity trigger overlap between skills

The checked-in `pre-commit` and `pre-push` hooks both run `mise run lint`, but
they only apply after `mise run hooks:install`. CI remains the enforcement path
for pull requests and pushes to `main`.

For a Claude plugin spot check, use its secure token prompt. For a Cursor plugin
spot check, configure `KONNECT_TOKEN` through the plugin dashboard. The Agent
Plugins package is intentionally skills-only until Konnect MCP supports
client-managed OAuth, so do not add a token placeholder merely to make its MCP
schema pass.

The shipped shared-skill payload lives under `plugins/kong-konnect/skills/`,
so install and publish checks should continue to reflect that source tree.

Run the repo tasks through `mise run ...`, not bare `uv ...`, when you want the
checked-in repo defaults. The `mise` config pins `uv` to Python `3.12` and
keeps the uv cache and managed Python installs under `.tmp/` instead of falling
back to user-profile locations.

## Shared Skill Installers

### `npx skills`

- Install path: [docs/install/other-tools.md](./install/other-tools.md)
- Prerequisite: `node` and `npx`
- Command: `npx skills add kong/ai-marketplace`
- Expected result: install completes without errors and the `gateway-plugin-datakit` skill is available in the target host
- Quick prompt: `When should you use the gateway-plugin-datakit skill?`
- Cleanup: remove the installed skill from the scratch project or discard the scratch project

### `gh skill`

- Install path: [docs/install/other-tools.md](./install/other-tools.md)
- Prerequisite: GitHub CLI `v2.90.0+`
- Note: `gh skill` is in public preview
- Command: `gh skill install kong/ai-marketplace`
- Single-skill command: `gh skill install kong/ai-marketplace gateway-plugin-datakit`
- Expected result: install completes without errors and the `gateway-plugin-datakit` skill is available in the target host
- Quick prompt: `When should you use the gateway-plugin-datakit skill?`
- Cleanup: remove the installed skill from the target host or discard the scratch profile

## GitHub Skill Publish Dry Run

- Command: `gh skill publish --dry-run`
- Use when: skill frontmatter changes, you add a new skill, or you are preparing a release
- Expected result: the repo validates against the Agent Skills specification and GitHub's publish checks without publishing anything
- Notes: this catches issues your local validator may not model, such as recommended frontmatter fields and repository publish settings

## Security Notes

- Prefer `gh skill preview` before installing from GitHub.
- Use scratch projects or disposable profiles when a host writes local plugin or extension state.
- Confirm Claude masks the token and never writes it into the plugin manifest or
  user-visible settings.
- Keep `KONNECT_TOKEN` out of checked-in files and shell examples that contain a
  real value.

## Tool Spot Checks

### Agent Plugins

- Install path: [docs/install/agent-plugins.md](./install/agent-plugins.md)
- Package root: `plugins/kong-konnect/`
- Verify: `plugin.json` validates against the pinned Agent Plugins 1.0.0 schema
  and all child skill directories pass `skills-ref`
- Expected MCP state before OAuth: no root `mcp.json`
- If a root `mcp.json` is added later: verify `streamable-http`, the pinned
  schema URL, and the absence of literal tokens or `${...}` placeholders in
  remote URLs and headers

### Claude Code

- Install path: [docs/install/claude-code.md](./install/claude-code.md)
- Configuration check: confirm enablement prompts for a masked token and a
  regional MCP URL whose default is `https://us.mcp.konghq.com`
- Verify after install: `kong-konnect` appears as installed and `gateway-plugin-datakit` is available in a fresh session
- MCP check when using the plugin path: select the resource region and confirm
  `kong-konnect` connects without exporting `KONNECT_TOKEN`
- Compatibility check: use a disposable `--plugin-dir` session when changing
  transport fields; Claude Code 2.1.226 loaded `$schema` plus
  `streamable-http`, while `claude plugin validate --strict` alone did not
  inspect MCP transport behavior
- Quick prompt: `What Kong-specific skills are available in this environment?`
- Cleanup: uninstall the plugin or discard the scratch profile

### Cursor

- Install path: [docs/install/cursor.md](./install/cursor.md)
- Local plugin path: `~/.cursor/plugins/local/kong-konnect/`
- Use a copied directory for the local plugin smoke test; do not rely on a symlinked plugin directory
- Verify after install: `kong-konnect` appears as installed and `gateway-plugin-datakit` is available in a fresh session
- MCP check when using the plugin path: confirm `kong-konnect` is configured
  from `plugins/kong-konnect/mcp.cursor.json` after entering the plugin variables
- Quick prompt: `What Kong-specific skills are available in this environment?`
- Cleanup: remove `~/.cursor/plugins/local/kong-konnect/` or discard the scratch profile

## When To Stop

You do not need to manually verify every tool for every change.

- Skill text only: `mise run lint` is usually enough.
- Tool-specific manifest or install doc: verify only that tool.
- Shared MCP config changes: verify one plugin-style path and one skill-plus-MCP path.
- Release prep: run `mise run lint` and spot-check the tools affected by the release.
- Release prep: also run `mise run ci` or `gh skill publish --dry-run`.
